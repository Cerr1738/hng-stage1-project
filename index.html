    <h2>Tech Goals</h2>

    <div class="div2">
      <p>
        In the next 2 years I want to be working for a company as Junior Frontend Developer, with also a team of other 
        developers, where we all work together to create solutions to tech issues and also help clients 
        build websites and webapps for thier various businesses. So what steps will I take to reach this goal?
        HGN Internship is the biggest step. With these two months Internship, I plan to sharpen my skills especially in Reactjs
        and that is the main programming language that will be used in this Internship. I also intend to master some backend technologies
        like NodeJs. It's a two months internship where I  will get the opportunity to work on real life projects and build up my portfolio. To learn more about this internship, 
        visit  <a href="https://hng.tech/learn" data-testid="hngLink">HNG Learn</a>.

    After my internship, with my portfolio built, I will like to use it to get an entry level developer job 
    or a long term internship at a company that will retain me after the intership. In 2025, after obtaining a full
    time entry job , I will work my way up to a Junior Frontend Developer and by 2026, I should have attained that goal.
    I am really eager to get through with all this stages and to work where my skills a used for the greater good, with
    a team of other Frontend and Backend Developers , advancing in the world of tech!
